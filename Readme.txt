This is my first contribution to Reddit and this forum. Six months ago I have started to learn Fusion 360 and design objects and parts. The first project after learning some Fusion 360 was a Case for my Fuji Camera Lens. So I created the case which consists of a base and a sliding cover with magnet twist lock. It is a robust case that could protect my lens during travelling - as a little touch I added the name of the lens on the cover and base. 

I month an half I purchased a Creality Ender 3 Pro Printer and finally yesterday after many tests and 17 hours o printing I saw the fruit of my work - A very nice feeling.


My design measures is all parametric - so I will be able to re-dimension for my other lens.

I have included the following files:

The cover and the base in the .STL file format
The cover and base in GCode
The cover, base, lens it was made for in the Fusion 360 Format f3d
A list of the measurements for reference

Hope this help
